My work has me in the car quite a bit during the week. After a recent holiday, I'm now on the road again. To make some use of the time spent driving and mainly to have some fun, I decided to do a little experiment. I have noticed the EUs mantra of *free movement of people, goods, services and capital* has lead to an increased diversity in the origins of cars and trucks on our roads as witnessed in the variety of country codes on license plates of vehicles driving around. So how international are our roads anyway? I decided to do a completely unscientific, unreproducible and highly circumstantial count of all different country codes I can spot in one month.

## Rules of the road
No game or experiment can be without some "rules". So here are the ones I'm applying:
* The license plate's country code must be clearly visible and seen, not assumed based on conventions (I.e. "Austrian plates have a little red border so that must have been one" - BTW, Danish plates sometimes have a similar feature...)
* The vehicle may be driving or standing still somewhere.
* No roaming around airport parking lots or holiday resorts to up the stats :)
* If it is a truck, the truck itself must have the spotted license plate. The trailer it happens to be lugging around does not count, since the trailer is not being driven. Especially nowadays, trailer and truck combinations are often not from the same country.

The goal is to see how many of the EU plates come up in a month. Below is the list I have managed to spot. Any plates from outside the EU are listed separately.

## Results

Start date: 7th of August
End date: 7th of September

Seen: 20
Total: 30
Percentage: 66.67%
