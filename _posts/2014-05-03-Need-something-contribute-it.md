One of the beautiful things about open source is that you can have a look under the hood to find out why things work the way they do. I recently ran into one of those things with Activiti and decided it wasn't fitting my needs. Instead of working around the problem, I decided to have a look myself, think of how to customize behavior for my needs and then merrily move along. Except I didn't. Turns out, my particular needs weren't so particular. So I ended up adding a new feature to Activiti itself for all to benefit from. 

Added benefit: now we don't have to maintain a custom extension, once it gets into an Activiti release.
